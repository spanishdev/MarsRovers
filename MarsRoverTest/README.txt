BIN => Inside this folder are a file called "MarsRover.jar". This file is the application binary file where
the program will be executed.

ABOUT THE TEST:
==========================================
I chose the Mars Rover test, where it simulates the movement of two Mars Rover test
in a plateau on Mars. 

HOW TO RUN IT:
==========================================

To run the program, just follow these steps:

STEP 1. Use the console (for instance, cmd in windows) and then write the following command:

java -jar <LOCATION_OF_THE_JAR_FILE>

If we have for instance, if the MarsRovers.jar is located in C:\Test\bin\ folder, the command should be:

java -jar C:\Test\bin\MarsRover.jar

STEP 2. When the program asks to, write the input file full path.

Example: If we have a file called "input.txt" located in "C:\Test\input\", the path would be:

C:\Test\input\input.txt

STEP 3. The program will execute and show the output to the console.

STEP 4. Press Enter to close the application.
